# Tableau-SampleSalesData

Sales data source:

https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls

The data in question has already been cleansed so we can proceed directly to uploading into tableau.

Further, there is only one table of data so we can proceed onto graphically representing the data.

The four representations that will make up this dashboard are the following:

-	Profit by Category
-	Profit by State
-	Profit by Segment
-	Quantity by Sub-Category

The justification for selecting these representations is two-fold, one, it mimics a real life request (for example, “I need a breakdown of where and what is making us profit”) and secondly, it allows me to demonstrate multiple visuals.
